# YE
a website that generates a random Kanye West quote and generates the google search results for it.

This website uses NodeJs and achieves it's function by using Kanye.rest API and Serpstack API.
This project's goal was to demonstrate the proper use of API's and a deep understanding of the NodeJs Architecture.
The code is writen in a procedural way, also is writen in such a way to force NodeJs to work Synchronously.


You can use my code, however you would need an API key for Serpstack.
If you want to try it, contact me and I'll consider sharing my key.




Below is a diagram of how this website works:
